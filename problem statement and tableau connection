Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female 
employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

SELECT 
    YEAR(d.from_date) AS calender_year,
    e.gender,
    COUNT(e.emp_no) AS employees_count
FROM
    t_employees e
        JOIN
    t_dept_emp d ON d.emp_no = e.emp_no
GROUP BY calender_year , e.gender
HAVING calender_year >= 1990;
