# Create the “before_salaries_update” trigger by executing the above statement. 

# Then, run the following UPDATE statement, with which we will modify the salary value of employee 10001 with another positive value.
UPDATE salaries 
SET

WHERE
    emp_no = '10001'
        AND from_date = '2010-06-22';

SELECT

    salaries
WHERE
    emp_no = '10001'
        AND from_date = '2010-06-22';
        
# Now, let’s run another UPDATE statement, with which we will try to modify the salary earned by 10001 with a negative value, minus 50,000.
UPDATE salaries 
SET 
    salary = - 50000
WHERE
    emp_no = '10001'

# Let’s run the same SELECT statement to check if the salary value was adjusted.
SELECT

    emp_no = '10001'
        AND from_date = '2010-06-22';
        
# No, it wasn’t. Everything remained intact. So, we can conclude that only an update with a salary higher than zero dollars per year 
# would be implemented.


# All right. For the moment, you know you have created only two triggers. But how could you prove that to someone who is seeing your 
# script for the first time?
# Well, in the ‘info’ section of the “employees” database, you can find a tab related to triggers. When you click on its name, 
# MySQL will show you the name, the related event, table, timing, and other characteristics regarding each trigger currently in use.  

# Awesome!

# Let’s introduce you to another interesting fact about MySQL. You already know there are pre-defined system variables, but system 
# functions exist too! 
# System functions can also be called built-in functions. 
# Often applied in practice, they provide data related to the moment of the execution of a certain query.

# For instance, SYSDATE() delivers the date and time of the moment at which you have invoked this function.
SELECT SYSDATE();

# Another frequently employed function, “Date Format”, assigns a specific format to a given date. For instance, the following query 
# could extract the current date, quoting the year, the month, and the day. 
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(SYSDATE(), '%y-%m-%d') as today;

# Of course, there are many other ways in which you could format a date; what we showed here was just an example.
# So, using system functions seems cool, doesn’t it?

# Wonderful! You already know how to work with the syntax that allows you to create triggers. 

# As an exercise, try to understand the following query. Technically, it regards the creation of a more complex trigger. 
#It is of the size that professionals often have to deal with.
